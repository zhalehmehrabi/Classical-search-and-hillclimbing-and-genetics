# Artificial intelligence using searches 
## classical searches
here in this project i implement all of this algorithm in both tree and 
graph form.there are some texts that they are some problems that i used this algorithms to solve.enjoy!
the genetics.txt is for coloring Irans all states.

### BFS
### DFS
### depth limited search
### uniform cost
### iterative deepening DFS
### greedy best-first search
### A*


## Hill climbing
and after all there are lots of hill climbings here
### Hill climbing
### Stochastic hill climbing
### first-choice hill climbing
### random restart hill climbing
### simulated annealing
